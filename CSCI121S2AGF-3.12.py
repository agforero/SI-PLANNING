'''
-   String stuff.
-   I should still go over some cImage though.
-   String pseudomath: stuff like <string> * 3.
-   Understanding strings as lists. For example,
'''

s = "St. Olaf College"

'''
-   s[0] will be S
-   s[6] will be a
-   s[-1] will be e (which is pretty wack)

-   a < b because a occurs earlier.
-   apple < bat because, again, a occurs earlier.

-   Capital letters come first in the dictionary, thus:
    APPLE < bat.
    apple > BAT. 

    Exercises:

-   Write a function that appends n numbers to a string, in order. For example:
    f(cat, 5) -> cat12345
-   Write a function that takes in five words and finds which of the five is first
    in alphabetical order.
-   Going off of that, write a function that takes in a list of strings and returns
    the same list sorted alphabetically.
