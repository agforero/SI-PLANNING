-   Boolean stuff
-   Comparators
-   Boolean operators
-   and 
-   or
-   not?
-   Logical opposites. Brain hurty
-   Literally just Formal Logic
-   Logic table?? Something like:

    Case 1: a = 0, b = 0
    Case 2: a = 0, b = 2            
                                    C1Eval  C2Eval
    Cond 1: a == 0 and b > 1        True    False
    Cond 2: a != 0 or  b <= 1       False   True

    Oh god this makes my brain hurt
-   Using Booleans to determine if a number is odd.

-   Make a function to check if first value n1 is greater than second value n2.
-   What is the logical opposite of:
    a == 0
    b < 5
    c >= 7

-   How about the logical opposite of:
    a == 5 and b <= 2
    a < 5 or b >=0

-   You're going on a vacation (to where, I don't know...decide for yourself, okay?)
    You start your vacation on a Friday. Based on the number of days you plan to
    be gone, write a function that computes whether or not you'll return on a Friday.

-   Write a function that will take in a float and round it down to the previous whole
    number. For example, 3.75 becomes 3 when plugged in.

-   Write a function isRightAngled(a,b,c) that computes if a triangle with the given
    sides is a right triangle. Assume c is the hypotenuse. The function from before
    might prove handy.
